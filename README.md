You can open the index.html file present in the folder or directly open the index.html present in the WebGL folder to start playing on your browser.

You can download the windows zip folder and play on your windows device by extracting all the files and running the application. You can play using WebGL if your browser supports it. Mozilla Firefox might support WebGL but in case it doesn't work you can follow these steps:-

Open command promt
Type "start chrome --allow--file--access--from--files" This will enable chrome to use third party applications but make sure no chrome windows are open before otherwise it won't work.
